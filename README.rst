The project is intended to generate test data for BI application depending on the table structure for the test data.
The table structure should be defined in the form of json file and should be placed in <sys.prefix>\testdatageneration\input.
After the code is executed, the data will be generated in csv format and these csv files with multiple combination of positive and negative format will be placed in the <sys.prefix>\testdatageneration\output folder of the project.
These files can be further utilised on need basis of the test case to be executed.
